# PL-880 RGB Backlight mod

As i find the orange backlight a bit not comfortable specially when there is no other light around, I gave it a try and changed it to pure red. Could have replaced the LED but instead I used a microcontroller and an RGB LED (a section f one LED taken from and RGB LED strip). 

So technically i can now program it to display any RGB color as well changing the brightness!
